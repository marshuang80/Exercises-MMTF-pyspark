While most Spark operations work on RDDs containing any type of objects, a few special operations are only available on RDDs of key-value pairs. The most common ones are distributed “shuffle” operations, such as grouping or aggregating the elements by a key.
In Python, these operations work on RDDs containing built-in Python tuples such as (1, 2). Simply create such tuples and then call your desired operation.
